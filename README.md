# Shelter-Animal-Outcomes

This Notebook explores the Shelter Animal Outcomes dataset, published for a Kaggle competition (link provided in the Notebook). The dataset is used for predicting the fate of shelter animals. Kaggle's data contain training and testing sets with information from October 1st, 2013 to March, 2016. There is a sample sumbission form, too. These files are explored in detail; it is assumed that features such as pet's age, gender, breed, and color could predict its fate, e.g., handed for adoption, returned to owners, etc. Label (outcome) prediction is a multiclass classification tasks; a solution was sought by applying several machine learning algorithms.
